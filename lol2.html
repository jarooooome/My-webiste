  For me, One Piece is one of the best anime out there, tho there are <br>
  numerous good animes, still, for me One Piece is the best!.

  My favorite character is Zoro, because he is so cool and I like his personality. <br>
  Even in the live action, he is so handsome, tho didn't like his personality :(

  One piece is so good!! It's so wholesome and funny, but can make you cry so hard sometimes too!! <br>
  you should try to watch it!
